## How we got here
Telegram recommends the Python libraries:

* `Telepot`. Python framework for Telegram Bot API.
[https://github.com/nickoala/telepot](https://github.com/nickoala/telepot)

* `twx.botapi`. Library and client + documentation with Python examples.
[https://github.com/datamachine/twx.botapi](https://github.com/datamachine/twx.botapi)

And googling you also find:

* `python-telegram-bot`. Pure Python interface for the Telegram Bot API. It's compatible with Python versions 2.7, 3.3+ and PyPy. It also works with Google App Engine.
[https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot)

So we choose `python-telegram-bot` after checking which had the biggest and most active community of users and also had good documentation.
